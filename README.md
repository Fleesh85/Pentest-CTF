# Pentest-CTF

<h2>Description</h2>
This project was to practice offensive security by exploiting a simulated company by the name of Rekall Corp. We were directed to exploit vulnerabilities in Rekall Corporation's Web Application, Linux Servers, and Windows Servers. After capturing the flags and screenshoting the findings, I generated a report to Rekall Corp displaying the vulnerabilites and providing mitigation tactics to help secure and prevent future attacks.
